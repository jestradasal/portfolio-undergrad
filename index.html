                    <h3>Hi! I'm Judyth. I'm a junior at Duke University pursuing an interdepartmental major between Computer Science and Sociology.</h3>
                </div>

                <div id=main-body>
                  <p>My technical interests include web development, machine learning and databases. I have had internships and other experiences where I have been able to explore these interests.
                    Although I am now an interdepartmental major, I am still interested in working in full technical roles after graduation.
                  </p>
                  <p> The other side of my interests include social justice, inequities existent within our society as well as different ways that technology can alleviate them. I first became
                    interested in the humanistic side of tech when I read an article on the use of algorithms to decide sentencing, and how these algorithms would disproportionately affect
                    people of color. Although these areas are wide, one field that I am most interested in is inequity in education and how technology can be harnessed to help fix it.
                  </p>
                  <p>One of the ways that I am exploring this is through my Bass Connections team this year - CSbyUs. Founded by three undergraduate Duke students, we develop a Computer Science
                  curriculum, teach it at various Durham middle schools and develop an open-source friendly web platform for teachers, students and others to use freely. The team believes that
                  Computer Science education is an effective way to benefit disadvantaged students.</p>
                  <p>Other areas that interest me include the medical field and its intersection with sociology and technology. Some of my favorite books include Survival of the Sickest, The Hate U Give
                  and Being Mortal.</p>
