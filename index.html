          <h2 class=section-title>About Me</h2>
          <p>My technical interests include web development, machine learning and databases. I have had internships and other experiences where I have been able to explore these interests.
            Although I am now an interdepartmental major, I am still interested in working in full technical roles after graduation.
          </p>
          <p> The other side of my interests include social justice, inequities existent within our society as well as different ways that technology can alleviate them. I first became
             interested in the humanistic side of tech when I read an article on the use of algorithms to decide sentencing, and how these algorithms would disproportionately affect
              people of color. Although these areas are wide, one field that I am most interested in is inequity in education and how technology can be harnessed to help fix it.
          </p>
          <p>One of the ways that I am exploring this is through my Bass Connections team this year - CSbyUs. Founded by three undergraduate Duke students, we develop a Computer Science
            curriculum, teach it at various Durham middle schools and develop an open-source friendly web platform for teachers, students and others to use freely. The team believes that
            Computer Science education is an effective way to benefit disadvantaged students.</p>
          <p>Other areas that interest me include the medical field and its intersection with sociology and technology. Some of my favorite books include Survival of the Sickest, The Hate U Give
            and Being Mortal.</p>

            <h3>SAT Scores in North Carolina</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Analysis of standardized SAT scores in North Carolina against various demographic variables
              (race, household income, % on reduced/free lunch, etc.).</li>
              <li>SAT data was pulled from online and converted into Postgres SQL database, from where
                training and testing data was obtained.</li>
              <li>Predicting algorithms were coded in Python and based on multivariable linear regression. Our results
                found that there was some association between certain variables and the scores.</li>
              <li>Results were also visualized using JavaScript and can be seen <a href="">here</a>.</li>
